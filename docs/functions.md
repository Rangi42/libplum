# Function reference

This page lists all functions exposed by the library's API, their arguments and return values, and their behavior.
The functions are grouped by functionality.
An alphabetical list (with links) is provided [in a separate page][alphabetical].

As it is mentioned in the [Conventions][conventions] page, all functions that take a pointer to `const` as an argument
treat the `const` qualifier as deep.
In other words, the function won't modify any of the data accessible through that pointer.

## Basic functionality

These functions implement the basic functionality of the library: loading and storing image files and creating and
releasing images.
Most simple uses of the library require these functions alone; users are encouraged to familiarize themselves with
them first.

The [`plum_new_image`](#plum_new_image), [`plum_copy_image`](#plum_copy_image), [`plum_load_image`](#plum_load_image)
and [`plum_load_image_limited`](#plum_load_image_limited) functions all serve the purpose of creating an image with
some data; therefore, they are collectively referred to elsewhere in the documentation as the _constructor functions_.
Likewise, the [`plum_destroy_image`](#plum_destroy_image) behaves as the corresponding destructor, releasing all
memory used by an image.
The [`plum_store_image`](#plum_store_image) function implements the other critical library feature: generating an
image file from image data.

### `plum_new_image`

``` c
struct plum_image * plum_new_image(void);
```

**Description:**

This function allocates a new image (i.e., a new [`struct plum_image`][image]), returning a pointer to it.
The image is zero-initialized, except for the `allocator` member, which is initialized appropriately.
This image struct is allocated as if by [`plum_malloc`](#plum_malloc), and will be deallocated by
[`plum_destroy_image`](#plum_destroy_image); see the [Memory management][memory] page for more details.

**Arguments:** none.

**Return value:**

Pointer to the new image, or a null pointer on failure due to memory exhaustion.

### `plum_copy_image`

``` c
struct plum_image * plum_copy_image(const struct plum_image * image);
```

**Description:**

This function creates a copy of an image.
The copy will contain its own copies of the pixel data, the palette data if any, and all the metadata nodes; metadata
nodes will be inserted in the same order as the original.
(However, the `userdata` member of the [`plum_image`][image] struct will be copied directly, since the library has no
way to know the layout of the user data stored in this member, if any.)

The function can fail if `image` or its `data` member are null pointers, or there's not enough memory to allocate all
the necessary buffers.

The image created by this function must be deallocated with the [`plum_destroy_image`](#plum_destroy_image) function;
see the [Memory management][memory] page for more details.

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image to be copied.

**Return value:**

Pointer to the copied image, or a null pointer on failure.

### `plum_load_image`

``` c
struct plum_image * plum_load_image(const void * restrict buffer,
                                    size_t size_mode, unsigned long flags,
                                    unsigned * restrict error);
```

**Description:**

This function, together with [`plum_store_image`](#plum_store_image), implements most of the library's functionality.
This function will load an image, automatically detecting the file format in use, and, if loading is successful,
return a [`plum_image`][image] struct for the application to use.

The image can be loaded from a memory buffer, from a file, from a [`plum_buffer`][buffer] struct, or through a
user-defined callback; see the [Loading and storing modes][loading-modes] page for more information.

The loaded image data will contain all of the image's frames, as well as all relevant nodes of [metadata][metadata].
Depending on the value of the `flags` argument, the image may use [indexed-color mode][indexed] or not; the `palette`
member can be used to determine which mode it uses.
(The `palette` member will be a null pointer if the image doesn't use a palette.)
The image's [color format][colors] (and its `color_format` member) will also be determined by the `flags` argument.

The image struct and the data buffers it will contain will be allocated as if by [`plum_malloc`](#plum_malloc), and
therefore must be released through the [`plum_destroy_image`](#plum_destroy_image) function.
See the [Memory management][memory] page for more details.

**Arguments:**

- `buffer`: pointer to the memory region from which the image file will be loaded.
  If `size_mode` is one of the constants indicating a [special loading mode][loading-modes], then this argument is the
  corresponding special value.
- `size_mode`: size of the memory buffer pointed to by `buffer` (up to [`PLUM_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`][mode-constants]), or
  constant indicating one of the [special loading modes][mode-constants].
  If this value is a size, it indicates that `buffer` points to a memory buffer, from where image data will be loaded.
  If this argument is one of the [special loading mode constants][mode-constants], it indicates that the image data
  will instead be loaded from a file, from a [`plum_buffer`][buffer] struct, or through callbacks.
  (Note: these special constants take up the highest possible `size_t` values, and therefore the risk of colliding
  with true buffer sizes is minimal; it is possible to use the `PLUM_MODE_BUFFER` special mode to mitigate this risk
  completely.
  The [`PLUM_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`][mode-constants] constant indicates the maximum value that will be treated as a true
  size and not a special constant, and is therefore equal to `SIZE_MAX` minus the number of mode constants.)
- `flags`: [color format][colors] and options used to load the image.
  This value is a bitwise OR (`|`) of any number of [loading flags constants][loading-flags], as follows:
    - [Color format][colors] constants, which will determine the color format that the image data will use.
      If this is omitted, the default format (`PLUM_COLOR_32`) will be used; it is _strongly_ recommended to never
      omit this value.
    - `PLUM_ALPHA_REMOVE`: indicates that the image must be loaded as fully opaque, even if it has transparency data;
      the alpha channel will be set to zero (or to its maximal value if `PLUM_ALPHA_INVERT` is specified as part of
      the [color format][colors]) when the image is loaded.
    - One of the [indexed-color mode][indexed] flags:
        - `PLUM_PALETTE_NONE` (default): specifies that the image will use direct-color mode, i.e., disables all
          palette functionality.
          If the image does have a palette, this palette will be removed on load and the pixel data will contain the
          colors directly.
          The `PLUM_PALETTE_NONE` constant has a value of zero, meaning that this mode is the default and will be used
          if none of the modes is specified.
        - `PLUM_PALETTE_LOAD`: instructs the library to load palettes when they exist; the image will use whatever
          mode is specified by the file's data.
          In other words, this mode preserves the image accurately: if it contains a palette, it will load that
          palette; if it doesn't contain one, it will load the pixel colors directly.
        - `PLUM_PALETTE_GENERATE`: indicates that the user wants the image to use indexed-color mode if possible.
          If the image has a palette, that palette will be loaded; in that case, the library will adjust the image's
          `max_palette_index` member if not all colors of the palette are used.
          (This is because this mode already specifies that the library may create palette data.)
          If the image doesn't have a palette, the library will attempt to create one; if the image uses 256 or fewer
          colors, this will succeed, and the image's pixel data will be replaced by color indexes.
          If the image uses more than 256 color values, which is the maximum allowed for a palette, no palette will be
          created and the image's pixel data will contain color values directly.
        - `PLUM_PALETTE_FORCE`: identical to `PLUM_PALETTE_GENERATE`, but it indicates that the user only accepts
          indexed-color mode images.
          If the library cannot create a palette because the image has too many colors, the image will fail to load
          with a [`PLUM_ERR_TOO_MANY_COLORS`][errors] error.
    - One of the palette-sorting constants (which will only be used if a new palette is generated or if sorting an
      existing palette is requested):
        - `PLUM_SORT_LIGHT_FIRST` (default): specifies that the brighest colors should be placed first in the palette.
          This constant has a value of zero, so this ordering will be used by default if none if specified.
        - `PLUM_SORT_DARK_FIRST`: specifies that the darkest colors should be placed first in the palette.
    - `PLUM_SORT_EXISTING`: indicates that, if the image already has a palette (and that palette is being loaded), the
      existing palette should be sorted (and the pixels' index values adjusted accordingly).
      By default, existing palettes are left untouched; only generated palettes are sorted.
    - `PLUM_PALETTE_REDUCE`: indicates that, if the image already has a palette (and that palette is being loaded),
      the palette should be reduced to a minimal palette, like [`plum_reduce_palette`](#plum_reduce_palette) would do
      (by removing duplicate and unused colors).
- `error`: pointer to an `unsigned` value that will be set to [an error constant][errors] if the function fails.
  If the function succeeds, that value will be set to zero.
  This argument can be a null pointer if the caller isn't interested in the reason why loading failed, as the failure
  itself can be detected through the return value.

**Return value:**

Pointer to the (newly-created) loaded [`struct plum_image`][image], or a null pointer on failure.
If the function fails and `error` is not a null pointer, `*error` will indicate the reason.

**Error values:**

If the `error` argument isn't a null pointer, the value it points to will be set to [an error constant][errors].
The error constants signal the following reasons for failure:

- `PLUM_OK` (zero): success.
  This value will be used only if the function succeeds, i.e., it returns a non-null pointer.
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS`: `buffer` is a null pointer, or `size_mode` is [`PLUM_MODE_BUFFER`][mode-constants] and
  `buffer` points to a [`struct plum_buffer`][buffer] whose `data` member is a null pointer.
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_FILE_FORMAT`: the image's file format wasn't recognized, or the image was damaged or couldn't be
  loaded for some reason.
  This indicates an error in the image data, such as an unexpected value.
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_COLOR_INDEX`: the image file uses [indexed-color mode][indexed] internally, but some of its pixels
  specify a color index that is out of range for the palette it defines.
- `PLUM_ERR_TOO_MANY_COLORS`: the [`PLUM_PALETTE_FORCE`][loading-flags] flag was specified, but a palette couldn't be
  generated because the image has more than 256 distinct color values.
- `PLUM_ERR_UNDEFINED_PALETTE`: the image file uses [indexed-color mode][indexed] internally, but doesn't define its
  palette.
  (This library doesn't support loading images with implicit palettes.)
- `PLUM_ERR_IMAGE_TOO_LARGE`: one of the image's dimensions (`width`, `height` or `frames`) doesn't fit in a 32-bit
  unsigned integer, or the image is too large to be accessed through an array index.
- `PLUM_ERR_NO_DATA`: one of the image's dimensions (`width`, `height` or `frames`) is zero.
  (This is possible for some image formats that allow image files to only contain ancillary data for further files to
  use, such as palettes or decoder tables; this library doesn't use data from other files when decoding an image file,
  and therefore those ancillary files cannot be loaded.)
- `PLUM_ERR_FILE_INACCESSIBLE`: the specified file could not be opened.
  This error can only occur when `size_mode` is set to [`PLUM_MODE_FILENAME`][mode-constants].
- `PLUM_ERR_FILE_ERROR`: an error occurred while reading the image data.
  This error can only occur when `size_mode` is set to [`PLUM_MODE_FILENAME`][mode-constants] or
  [`PLUM_MODE_CALLBACK`][mode-constants].
- `PLUM_ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`: there is not enough memory available to load the image.

### `plum_load_image_limited`

``` c
struct plum_image * plum_load_image_limited(const void * restrict buffer,
                                            size_t size_mode,
                                            unsigned long flags, size_t limit,
                                            unsigned * restrict error);
```

**Description:**

This function is identical to [`plum_load_image`](#plum_load_image), but it enforces a limit on the number of pixels
that the loaded image can have.
This function is intended to deal with untrusted image data, where a specially-crafted malicious image file can create
a massive image out of a seemingly small amount of input data.
For further information, check the [Untrusted image files][untrusted] section.

The limit applies to the image as a whole, not to each dimension: the library will enforce that the number of pixels
in the entire image (i.e., `width * height * frames`) is not greater than the specified limit.
Specifying a limit of `SIZE_MAX` will make this function behave like [`plum_load_image`](#plum_load_image).

**Arguments:**

The `buffer`, `size_mode`, `flags` and `error` arguments have the same meanings as for the
[`plum_load_image`](#plum_load_image) function.

- `limit`: maximum number of pixels the loaded image is allowed to have; attempting to load an image with more pixels
  than the specified value will fail.

**Return value:**

Pointer to the (newly-created) loaded [`struct plum_image`][image], or a null pointer on failure.
If the function fails and `error` is not a null pointer, `*error` will indicate the reason.
(This is the same as for [`plum_load_image`](#plum_load_image).)

**Error values:**

If the `error` argument isn't a null pointer, the value it points to will be set to [an error constant][errors].

This function can fail for any of the reasons specified in the [`plum_load_image`](#plum_load_image) function.
In addition, the following error may occur:

- `PLUM_ERR_IMAGE_TOO_LARGE`: the image's pixel count exceeded the limit specified by `limit`.

### `plum_store_image`

``` c
size_t plum_store_image(const struct plum_image * image, void * restrict buffer,
                        size_t size_mode, unsigned * restrict error);
```

**Description:**

This function, together with [`plum_load_image`](#plum_load_image), implements most of the library's functionality.
This function will write out an image's data, in the format indicated by its `type` member; this is the only use of
that member after an image has been loaded, and therefore, the way the user can choose the format in which image data
is generated.

The image data can be written out to a memory buffer, a file, an automatically-allocated buffer in a
[`plum_buffer`][buffer] struct, or through a user-defined callback; see the [Loading and storing modes][loading-modes]
page for more information.

If the `size_mode` argument is set to [`PLUM_MODE_BUFFER`][mode-constants], the `buffer` argument will point to a
[`plum_buffer`][buffer] struct whose `data` member will be automatically allocated by the function if it succeeds,
using the `malloc` standard function.
In this case, the user is responsible for calling `free` on it after using it; this memory is **not** managed by the
library.
(If the `free` function isn't available, a special mode of [`plum_free`](#plum_free) may be used; see that function's
description for more information.)

The image written out will attempt to mirror the image data to the best of the format's abilities.
For example, if the chosen format supports [indexed-color mode][indexed], and the image uses it, the generated image
data will use that mode as well.
However, not all formats support all of the library's features.
For more information on which formats support which features, see the [Supported file formats][formats] page.

In some cases, the chosen format won't be able to represent the image at all.
(For example, the image may have more than one frame, and the chosen format only supports single-frame images.)
In that case, this function will fail; the error code returned through the `error` parameter will explain the reason
for that failure.

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image that will be written out.
- `buffer`: pointer to the memory region where the image data will be written.
  If `size_mode` is one of the constants indicating a [special storing mode][loading-modes], then this argument is the
  corresponding special value.
- `size_mode`: size of the memory buffer pointed to by `buffer` (up to [`PLUM_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`][mode-constants]), or
  constant indicating one of the [special loading modes][mode-constants].
  If this value is a size, it indicates that `buffer` points to a memory buffer, where image data will be written.
  If this argument is one of the [special loading mode constants][mode-constants], it indicates that the image data
  will instead be written out to a file, an automatically-allocated [`plum_buffer`][buffer] struct, or through
  callbacks.
  (Note: these special constants take up the highest possible `size_t` values, and therefore the risk of colliding
  with true buffer sizes is minimal.
  The [`PLUM_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`][mode-constants] constant indicates the maximum value that will be treated as a true
  size and not a special constant, and is therefore equal to `SIZE_MAX` minus the number of mode constants.)
- `error`: pointer to an `unsigned` value that will be set to [an error constant][errors] if the function fails.
  If the function succeeds, that value will be set to zero.
  This argument can be a null pointer if the caller isn't interested in the reason why writing out the image failed,
  as the failure itself can be detected through the return value.

**Return value:**

If the function succeeds, it will return the number of bytes written.
(If `size_mode` equals [`PLUM_MODE_BUFFER`][mode-constants], then the return value will be equal to the size of the
allocated buffer.)
If the function fails, it will return zero (which is never a valid return value on success).
In this case, if `error` is not a null pointer, `*error` will indicate the reason.

**Error values:**

If the `error` argument isn't a null pointer, the value it points to will be set to [an error constant][errors].

This function can fail for any of the reasons specified in the [`plum_validate_image`](#plum_validate_image) function,
setting the error code to that function's return value.
In addition to those results, the following error codes may be set:

- `PLUM_OK` (zero): success.
  This value will be used only if the function succeeds, i.e., it returns a non-zero value.
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS`: `image` or `buffer` are null pointers, or `size_mode` is zero.
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_FILE_FORMAT`: the image's `type` member is [`PLUM_IMAGE_NONE`][types].
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_COLOR_INDEX`: the image uses [indexed-color mode][indexed], but some of the pixels in the image
  have an invalid color index (i.e., a value greater than the image's `max_palette_index`).
- `PLUM_ERR_TOO_MANY_COLORS`: the chosen image format (given by the image's `type` member) only supports images with
  a certain number of colors, and the image uses more than that.
- `PLUM_ERR_IMAGE_TOO_LARGE`: the image's dimensions are larger than what the chosen image format (given by the
  image's `type` member) supports, or the image is too large to fit in the specified buffer size (which can only occur
  if `size_mode` isn't set to any of the [special storing mode constants][mode-constants]).
  (Note: this does **not** apply when the chosen format only supports single-frame images and the image's `frames`
  member is larger than one; the `PLUM_ERR_NO_MULTI_FRAME` error code is used instead in that case.)
- `PLUM_ERR_NO_MULTI_FRAME`: the chosen image format (given by the image's `type` member) only supports single-frame
  images, but the image has more than one frame (i.e., the image's `frames` member is greater than 1).
- `PLUM_ERR_FILE_INACCESSIBLE`: the specified file could not be opened for writing.
  This error can only occur when `size_mode` is set to [`PLUM_MODE_FILENAME`][mode-constants].
- `PLUM_ERR_FILE_ERROR`: an error occurred while writing out the image data.
  This error can only occur when `size_mode` is set to [`PLUM_MODE_FILENAME`][mode-constants] or
  [`PLUM_MODE_CALLBACK`][mode-constants].
- `PLUM_ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`: there is not enough memory available to complete the operation.

### `plum_destroy_image`

``` c
void plum_destroy_image(struct plum_image * image);
```

**Description:**

This function deallocates all memory resources associated to an image.

If the image has been created with one of the [constructor functions](#basic-functionality), then this function will
destroy the image itself, along with all buffers created by the function that created it.
Regardless of how the image was created, this function will also deallocate any memory associated to the image that
has been allocated by [`plum_malloc`](#plum_malloc), [`plum_calloc`](#plum_calloc), [`plum_realloc`](#plum_realloc) or
[`plum_allocate_metadata`](#plum_allocate_metadata) and hasn't been released yet by [`plum_free`](#plum_free).

If this function is called on an image created with one of the [constructor functions](#basic-functionality), since
the image itself will be destroyed, that struct cannot be used at all after the call.
(It must be considered freed.)
On the other hand, if the image was statically allocated (or allocated by the program without invoking one of the
library's functions), this function will reset the image's `allocator` member, which will allow reusing it.
However, in that case, if any of the buffers referenced by the image's members has been allocated by the
[memory management functions](#memory-management), those buffers will have been freed, so special care must be taken.

If the image was not created by one of the [constructor functions](#basic-functionality) and no memory is associated
to it, this function will do nothing.
It will also do nothing if the `image` argument is a null pointer.
Therefore, it is always safe (and recommended) to call this function when the user will stop using an image.

**Arguments:**

- `image`: pointer to the image that will be destroyed.

**Return value:** none.

## Validation

These functions validate various aspects of an image, allowing the user to detect errors before attempting to write it
out to a file.

### `plum_validate_image`

``` c
unsigned plum_validate_image(const struct plum_image * image);
```

**Description:**

This function will validate the contents of a [`plum_image`][image] struct, ensuring that all of its members are set
to reasonable values.
It will also validate the contents of known [metadata nodes][metadata], checking that their data sizes match what is
expected and that their contents are valid.
(Metadata nodes with negative types won't be checked, since their structure is defined by the user, not the library.)

Note: this function will _not_ check pixel values for validity, since that check alone would be significantly slower
than all other checks combined.
Use the [`plum_validate_palette_indexes`](#plum_validate_palette_indexes) function for that purpose.
(That function can also quickly handle images that don't need any validation, such as images that don't use
[indexed-color mode][indexed] in the first place.)

**Arguments:**

- `image`: pointer to the image that will be validated.

**Return value:**

If validation is successful, the function returns zero ([`PLUM_OK`][errors]).
If validation fails, the function will return a non-zero [error constant][errors] indicating the check that failed.

**Error values:**

These are the possible error values that the function can return:

- `PLUM_OK` (zero): success.
  This value will be returned only if all checks pass, i.e., if the image is valid.
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS`: `image` is a null pointer.
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_FILE_FORMAT`: the image's `type` member is set to an invalid value.
  (Note that the [`PLUM_IMAGE_NONE`][types] type will _not_ be considered invalid by this function.
  However, [`plum_image_store`](#plum_image_store) will still refuse to write out an image with that type.)
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_METADATA`: one of the image's [metadata nodes][metadata] has an unknown type (i.e., a positive
  type that is not one of the types defined by the library), a non-zero `size` with a null `data` pointer, or a size
  or contents that don't fulfill the constraints given in the [Metadata][metadata] page.
- `PLUM_ERR_IMAGE_TOO_LARGE`: the image's dimensions are too large for the pixel buffer size to fit in a `size_t`
  value.
  This is checked with the [`plum_check_valid_image_size`](#plum_check_valid_image_size) function.
- `PLUM_ERR_NO_DATA`: either the image's `data` member (i.e., its pixel data) is a null pointer, or one of the image's
  dimensions is zero, indicating that the image has no pixels.

### `plum_check_valid_image_size`

``` c
int plum_check_valid_image_size(uint32_t width, uint32_t height,
                                uint32_t frames);
```

**Description:**

This function verifies that the size of an image's pixel buffer can be represented as a `size_t` value, regardless of
the image's [color format][colors] and whether it uses [indexed-color mode][indexed] or not.

In other words, it checks that `width * height * frames * sizeof(uint64_t)` doesn't overflow a `size_t`.

Note that it does _not_ check whether that size will fit in memory, or if it is at all reasonable.
This function only checks for overflow; it is intended to prevent security issues that derive from overflowing sizes.

**Arguments:**

- `width`: width of the image.
- `height`: height of the image.
- `frames`: number of frames in the image.

(Note that, since the function's purpose is to validate a product, the arguments are actually interchangeable.)

**Return value:**

1 if the size is valid, or 0 if it overflows.

### `plum_check_limited_image_size`

``` c
int plum_check_limited_image_size(uint32_t width, uint32_t height,
                                  uint32_t frames, size_t limit);
```

**Description:**

This function performs the same check as [`plum_check_valid_image_size`](#plum_check_valid_image_size), but it also
ensures that the total number of pixels (i.e., the product of the three dimensions) is no larger than the value
specified by the `limit` argument.

This function's main purpose is to ensure that an image meets restrictions like those that can be imposed by
[`plum_load_image_limited`](#plum_load_image_limited).

**Arguments:**

- `width`: width of the image.
- `height`: height of the image.
- `frames`: number of frames in the image.
- `limit`: maximum number of pixels the image is allowed to have.

**Return value:**

1 if the size is valid and no greater than the specified limit, or 0 if it is too large or it overflows.

### `plum_validate_palette_indexes`

``` c
const uint8_t * plum_validate_palette_indexes(const struct plum_image * image);
```

**Description:**

This function validates the pixel values of an image.

If an image uses [indexed-color mode][indexed], pixel values (i.e., indexes) must be smaller than or equal to the
image's `max_palette_index` value.
This function checks those values and finds the first value that is out of range.

Images that use full 256-color palettes, as well as images that don't use [indexed-color mode][indexed] at all, don't
need any validation, since all pixel values are valid for those images.
This function handles those images quickly and returns a null pointer for them, ensuring that it can be called for any
image.

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image to validate.

**Return value:**

Null pointer if all pixel values are valid (or if `image` itself is a null pointer).
Pointer to the first invalid pixel (i.e., a pointer within `image -> data8`) otherwise.

## Color operations

These functions perform various operations and transformations on color values directly, such as converting between
different [color formats][colors].

### `plum_convert_color`

``` c
uint64_t plum_convert_color(uint64_t color, unsigned long from,
                            unsigned long to);
```

**Description:**

This function converts a single color value from any [color format][colors] to any other.

The color formats are specified using the constants described in the [Color formats][colors] page; only the color
format bits are used by this function (in other words, other bits, such as those coming from
[loading flags][loading-flags], are ignored).

**Arguments:**

- `color`: color value to convert.
- `from`: `color`'s current [color format][colors].
- `to`: [color format][colors] to convert to.

**Return value:**

Converted color value.
The result is unspecified if `color` is out of range for the format specified by `from`.

### `plum_convert_colors`

``` c
void plum_convert_colors(void * restrict destination,
                         const void * restrict source, size_t count,
                         unsigned long to, unsigned long from);
```

**Description:**

This function converts an array of color values from any [color format][colors] to any other.
It is equivalent to calling [`plum_convert_color`](#plum_convert_color) on each value in the array.
However, this function will automatically handle converting between [color formats][colors] of different sizes.

The `destination` buffer must be large enough to store `count` colors in the format specified by `to`; this might not
be the same size as the `source` array if the specified color formats are of different sizes.
As indicated by the `restrict` keyword, the `source` and `destination` arrays must not overlap.

Note that the `to` and `from` arguments are in reverse order with respect to the
[`plum_convert_color`](#plum_convert_color) function.
This was done to match the order of the `destination` and `source` arguments.

The color formats are specified using the constants described in the [Color formats][colors] page; only the color
format bits are used by this function (in other words, other bits, such as those coming from
[loading flags][loading-flags], are ignored).

**Arguments:**

- `destination`: buffer where the converted color values will be stored; it must be large enough to store `count`
  color values in the format specified by `to`.
  This argument must not be a null pointer unless `count` is zero.
- `source`: buffer containing the color values to be converted; it must contain `count` color values in the format
  specified by `from`, and it must not overlap with `destination`.
  This argument must not be a null pointer unless `count` is zero.
- `count`: number of color values to convert.
  If this value is zero, no conversions are performed.
- `to`: [color format][colors] to convert to.
- `from`: current [color format][colors] for the values in `source`.

**Return value:** none.

### `plum_remove_alpha`

``` c
void plum_remove_alpha(struct plum_image * image);
```

**Description:**

This function removes transparency data from an image, in the same way the [`PLUM_ALPHA_REMOVE`][loading-flags] flag
does when loading an image with [`plum_load_image`](#plum_load_image).

The function operates in place and modifies the image's color or palette values, making them all opaque.
(In other words, it sets the alpha channel of all color values to zero, or to its maximal value if the image's
[color format][colors] includes the [`PLUM_ALPHA_INVERT`][loading-flags] flag.)

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image to transform.
  If this argument is a null pointer, the function does nothing.

**Return value:** none.

### `plum_sort_colors`

``` c
void plum_sort_colors(const void * restrict colors, uint8_t max_index,
                      unsigned long flags, uint8_t * restrict result);
```

**Description:**

This function sorts an array of colors, in the same way [`plum_load_image`](#plum_load_image) does when generating a
new palette (or sorting an existing one).

The function writes out an array of indexes containing the result of the sort.
For example, if `result[0]` is 36, that means that index 36 in the original array corresponds to the first color after
sorting.

This function **does not** modify the original array.
That is because the function's primary use is to sort an image's colors, and doing that requires sorting the palette
and updating the index values for all pixels; a sorted array of indexes allows the user to perform both operations.
(To do all of this automatically for an image, use the [`plum_sort_palette`](#plum_sort_palette) function instead.)

**Arguments:**

- `colors`: array of colors to sort.
  Must not be a null pointer.
- `max_index`: maximum valid index into `colors`, in the same manner the `max_palette_index` member of a
  [`struct plum_image`][image] is specified.
  Note that this is _one less_ than the number of colors in the array.
- `flags`: [color format][colors] and sorting mode used to sort the array.
  This value is a bitwise OR (`|`) of the following values, taken from the [loading flags constants][loading-flags]
  (other bits from those flags will be ignored):
    - [Color format][colors] constants, which determine the color format used for the values in the `colors` array.
      If this is omitted, the default format (`PLUM_COLOR_32`) will be used; it is _strongly_ recommended to never
      omit this value.
    - One of the palette-sorting constants:
        - `PLUM_SORT_LIGHT_FIRST` (default): specifies that the brighest colors should be sorted first.
          This constant has a value of zero, so this ordering will be used by default if none if specified.
        - `PLUM_SORT_DARK_FIRST`: specifies that the darkest colors should be sorted first.
- `result`: array of `uint8_t` values where the sorted indexes will be stored.
  Must not overlap with `colors`.

**Return value:** none.

### `plum_color_buffer_size`

``` c
size_t plum_color_buffer_size(size_t size, unsigned long flags);
```

**Description:**

This function calculates the size that a buffer would have to have to be able to contain a given number of color
values using a chosen [color format][colors].
This can be used to calculate allocation sizes, `memcpy` sizes, etc.

**Arguments:**

- `size`: number of colors in the buffer.
- `flags`: [color format][colors] that the buffer will use.
  This argument is named `flags` after the argument to [`plum_load_image`](#plum_load_image), but only the color
  format bits are used; other [loading flags][loading-flags] are ignored.

**Return value:**

If `size` is valid (i.e., `size * sizeof(uint64_t)` doesn't overflow a `size_t`), this function returns the number of
bytes that many colors would take.
(In particular, that means that `plum_color_buffer_size(1, format)` can be used to obtain the size of a single color
value for any given [color format][colors].)

If `size` is not valid (i.e., it would overflow for some color formats), the function returns 0.
This happens regardless of whether the specific color format indicated by `flags` would cause the calculation to
overflow.

## Palette operations

These functions operate on palettes, assisting the user in converting images to and from [indexed-color mode][indexed]
and in manipulating the palettes already there.

### `plum_convert_colors_to_indexes`

``` c
int plum_convert_colors_to_indexes(uint8_t * restrict destination,
                                   const void * restrict source,
                                   void * restrict palette,
                                   size_t count, unsigned long flags);
```

**Description:**

This function generates a palette out of an array of color values, as well as the corresponding array of indexes.

The library only supports palettes of up to 256 colors; if the array contains more than 256 distinct color values,
generating the palette will fail.

If generating the palette succeeds, the function will convert the color values in `source` to indexes into the
palette, which will be stored in `destination`.
The palette itself will be written to `palette`.
Therefore, this function can be used to convert an image to [indexed-color mode][indexed], generating both the pixel
data (for the [`plum_image`][image] struct's `data` member) and its palette (for the image's `palette` member).

As indicated by the `restrict` keyword, the `destination`, `source` and `palette` buffers must not overlap.

**Arguments:**

- `destination`: buffer where the new palette indexes will be written if the function succeeds.
  Must not be a null pointer.
- `source`: array of color values, in the [color format][colors] given by the `flags` argument.
  Must not be a null pointer.
- `palette`: buffer where the palette colors will be written if the function succeeds; it should have enough space for
  up to 256 color values (in the [color format][colors] specified by the `flags` argument), since that is the maximum
  number of colors that a palette can use.
  Must not be a null pointer.
- `count`: number of color values in the `source` array (and therefore, number of indexes that will be written to
  `destination` on success).
  Must not be zero.
- `flags`: [color format][colors] and sorting mode used for `source` and `palette`.
  This value is a bitwise OR (`|`) of the following values, taken from the [loading flags constants][loading-flags]
  (other bits from those flags will be ignored):
    - [Color format][colors] constants, which determine the color format used for the values in the `source` array,
      as well as the color format that `palette` will use.
      If this is omitted, the default format (`PLUM_COLOR_32`) will be used; it is _strongly_ recommended to never
      omit this value.
    - One of the palette-sorting constants, which will be used for the generated palette:
        - `PLUM_SORT_LIGHT_FIRST` (default): specifies that the brighest colors should be sorted first.
          This constant has a value of zero, so this ordering will be used by default if none if specified.
        - `PLUM_SORT_DARK_FIRST`: specifies that the darkest colors should be sorted first.

**Return value:**

If this function succeeds, it returns the maximum index value used by the palette, in the same manner that the
`max_palette_index` member of a [`struct plum_image`][image] is specified.
Note that this is _one less_ than the number of colors in the palette; in particular, it may be zero if the palette
only contains one color.
(The maximum possible return value is 255, for a 256-color palette.)

If the function fails, it will return a negative [error constant][errors].
(For example, if a `PLUM_ERR_TOO_MANY_COLORS` error occurs, the function will return `-PLUM_ERR_TOO_MANY_COLORS`.)
Since all error constants are positive, the function will always return a negative value on error.

**Error values:**

If the return value is negative, it will be the negated value of one of the following [error constants][errors]:

- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS`: one of the pointer arguments is a null pointer, or `size` is zero.
- `PLUM_ERR_TOO_MANY_COLORS`: the `source` array contains more than 256 distinct color values, and therefore a palette
  cannot be generated.
- `PLUM_ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`: there isn't enough memory available to complete the operation.

### `plum_convert_indexes_to_colors`

``` c
void plum_convert_indexes_to_colors(void * restrict destination,
                                    const uint8_t * restrict source,
                                    const void * restrict palette,
                                    size_t count, unsigned long flags);
```

**Description:**

This function converts an array of palette indexes, along with its corresponding palette, into an array of color
values.
In other words, it is the inverse of [`plum_convert_colors_to_indexes`](#plum_convert_colors_to_indexes).

Unlike that function, this function's conversion will always succeed, as it is always possible to represent colors as
an array of color values.

As indicated by the `restrict` keyword, the `destination`, `source` and `palette` buffers must not overlap.

**Arguments:**

- `destination`: buffer where the color values will be written; it must have enough space for `count` values in the
  [color format][colors] determined by `flags`.
  Must not be a null pointer.
- `source`: array of `count` palette indexes that will be converted.
  Must not be a null pointer.
- `palette`: color palette used by `source`; it uses the [color format][colors] determined by `flags`, and it must
  have as many entries as needed for all indexes in `source` to be valid.
  (For instance, if the indexes in `source` are all between 0 and 4, `palette` must contain at least 5 entries.)
  Must not be a null pointer.
- `count`: number of indexes in `source`, and therefore number of color values that will be written to `destination`.
- `flags`: [color format][colors] that `palette` and `destination` will use.
  This argument is named `flags` after the argument to [`plum_load_image`](#plum_load_image), but only the color
  format bits are used; other [loading flags][loading-flags] are ignored.

**Return value:** none.

### `plum_sort_palette`

``` c
unsigned plum_sort_palette(struct plum_image * image, unsigned long flags);
```

**Description:**

This function sorts an image's existing palette, in place.
It also updates the image's color values (i.e., indexes) to point to the new indexes for the same colors.

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image whose palette will be sorted.
- `flags`: one of the following values, taken from [loading flags constants][loading-flags] (other bits from the
  value, including [color format][colors] bits, will be ignored):
    - `PLUM_SORT_LIGHT_FIRST` (default): specifies that the brighest colors should be sorted first.
      This constant has a value of zero, so 0 may be used instead of the constant.
    - `PLUM_SORT_DARK_FIRST`: specifies that the darkest colors should be sorted first.

**Return value:**

Zero ([`PLUM_OK`][errors]) on success, or a non-zero [error constant][errors] on error.

**Error values:**

The function may fail for any of the reasons specified for [`plum_validate_image`](#plum_validate_image), returning
one of the error constants listed there.

It can also return one of the following [error constants][errors]:

- `PLUM_OK` (zero): success.
  This value will be used only if the function executes without errors.
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_COLOR_INDEX`: the image contains an invalid color index (i.e.,
  [`plum_validate_palette_indexes`](#plum_validate_palette_indexes) returns a non-null pointer).
- `PLUM_ERR_UNDEFINED_PALETTE`: the image doesn't use [indexed-color mode][image] at all (i.e., it doesn't have a
  palette to begin with).

### `plum_sort_palette_custom`

``` c
unsigned plum_sort_palette_custom(struct plum_image * image,
                                  uint64_t (* callback) (void *, uint64_t),
                                  void * argument, unsigned long flags);
```

**Description:**

This function sorts an image's existing palette, in place, like [`plum_sort_palette`](#plum_sort_palette) does, but
with a sorting criterion defined by the user.
Like [`plum_sort_palette`](#plum_sort_palette), it also updates the image's color values (i.e., indexes) to point to
the new indexes for the same colors.

The sorting criterion will be defined by the function pointed to by the `callback` argument, which must return a
sorting score for each color value; the colors will be sorted in ascending order of scores, with ties being broken by
the existing palette order.

The `flags` argument indicates the [color format][colors] expected by the callback function; if the image uses a
different color format, the color values will be converted to the designated format before being passed to the
callback function.
This will **not** modify the image's color format: the color values will only be converted for the callback.
(The function signature takes a `uint64_t` argument so that callbacks may accept any color format, but the library
will ensure that the value actually passed to the callback will be in range for the chosen color format.)

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image whose palette will be sorted.
- `callback`: callback function that will be called to assign sorting scores to each color in the image's palette.
  The callback function will be called with two arguments: the value given to `argument` and the color value converted
  to the color format designated by `flags`.
- `argument`: first argument that will be passed to the callback function each time it is called.
- `flags`: [color format][colors] that the function designated by `callback` expects.
  This argument is named `flags` after the argument to [`plum_load_image`](#plum_load_image), but only the color
  format bits are used; other [loading flags][loading-flags] are ignored.

**Return value:**

Zero ([`PLUM_OK`][errors]) on success, or a non-zero [error constant][errors] on error.

**Error values:**

The function may fail for any of the reasons specified for [`plum_validate_image`](#plum_validate_image), returning
one of the error constants listed there.

It can also return one of the following [error constants][errors]:

- `PLUM_OK` (zero): success.
  This value will be used only if the function executes without errors.
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS`: `callback` is a null pointer.
  (This error will also occur if `image` is a null pointer, as specified by
  [`plum_validate_image`](#plum_validate_image).)
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_COLOR_INDEX`: the image contains an invalid color index (i.e.,
  [`plum_validate_palette_indexes`](#plum_validate_palette_indexes) returns a non-null pointer).
- `PLUM_ERR_UNDEFINED_PALETTE`: the image doesn't use [indexed-color mode][image] at all (i.e., it doesn't have a
  palette to begin with).

### `plum_reduce_palette`

``` c
unsigned plum_reduce_palette(struct plum_image * image);
```

**Description:**

This function reduces an image's palette to the minimal palette that will still represent the same image, by removing
duplicate and unused colors from the palette.
The remaining colors remain sorted in the same order as before; duplicate colors are sorted by their first appearance
in the image's palette.

This function will also update the image's `max_palette_index` member to reflect the number of colors in the image's
palette after reducing it.

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image whose palette will be reduced.

**Return value:**

Zero ([`PLUM_OK`][errors]) on success, or a non-zero [error constant][errors] on error.

**Error values:**

The function may fail for any of the reasons specified for [`plum_validate_image`](#plum_validate_image), returning
one of the error constants listed there.

It can also return one of the following [error constants][errors]:

- `PLUM_OK` (zero): success.
  This value will be used only if the function executes without errors.
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_COLOR_INDEX`: the image contains an invalid color index (i.e.,
  [`plum_validate_palette_indexes`](#plum_validate_palette_indexes) returns a non-null pointer).
- `PLUM_ERR_UNDEFINED_PALETTE`: the image doesn't use [indexed-color mode][image] at all (i.e., it doesn't have a
  palette to begin with).

### `plum_get_highest_palette_index`

``` c
int plum_get_highest_palette_index(const struct plum_image * image);
```

**Description:**

This function returns the highest palette index in use for an image.
(This value is simply the highest value in the `image -> data8` array.)

**Arguments:**

- `image`: the image whose highest palette index will be obtained.

**Return value:**

If the function succeeds, it returns the highest palette index used by any pixel in the image.
(This will be a value between 0 and 255.)

If the function fails, it returns a negated [error constant][errors]. For example, if it fails due to a
`PLUM_ERR_NO_DATA` error, it will return `-PLUM_ERR_NO_DATA`.
Since all error constants are positive, the function will always return a negative value on error.

**Error values:**

The function may fail for any of the reasons specified for [`plum_validate_image`](#plum_validate_image), returning
the negated value of any of the error constants listed there.

The function may also return the negated value of the following [error constant][errors]:

- `PLUM_ERR_UNDEFINED_PALETTE`: the image doesn't use [indexed-color mode][image] at all (i.e., it doesn't have a
  palette to begin with).

Note that the function will _not_ fail with a `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_COLOR_INDEX` error if there is an invalid color index,
since one of this function's purposes is to obtain a new value for the `max_palette_index` member of the image's data.

## Miscellaneous image operations

These functions perform some operations on image data that don't fall into any of the categories above.

### `plum_find_metadata`

``` c
struct plum_metadata * plum_find_metadata(const struct plum_image * image,
                                          int type);
```

**Description:**

This function finds a [metadata node][metadata] in an image, given its type.
If there are multiple nodes with the same type, the function returns the first one found.

(For positive types, which are types defined by the library, it is not valid for an image to have more than one of
each, anyway.)

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image to search.
- `type`: metadata type to search for.
  For positive, library-defined types, this should be one of the [metadata constants][metadata-constants].

**Return value:**

If a node with the chosen type is found, the function returns a pointer to it.
Otherwise (or if `image` is a null pointer), it returns a null pointer.

### `plum_rotate_image`

``` c
unsigned plum_rotate_image(struct plum_image * image, unsigned count, int flip);
```

**Description:**

This function rotates and/or vertically flips an image.
If the image has multiple frames, the same transformation is applied on each frame.

The function operates in place, updating the image's pixel data.
(If `count` is odd, it will also swap its `width` and `height` members, indicating the new dimensions of the image.)

Rotations are always clockwise; however, since only the two least significant bits are used by the function (because
four rotations cancel out), negative values may be used to rotate counterclockwise.
If the arguments specify both a rotation and a vertical flip, the rotation is applied first.

Note that every possible rotation and reflection can be obtained as a combination of a clockwise rotation and a
vertical flip, as shown in the [Rotation sample][rotation] page.

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image to rotate and/or flip.
- `count`: number of clockwise rotations to perform.
  Since 4 rotations are equivalent to doing nothing, this value will be reduced modulo 4.
  (Note that, due to how unsigned values work, a negative rotation count will rotate the image counterclockwise.)
- `flip`: non-zero if the image must be vertically flipped (after rotating it, if applicable), or zero otherwise.

**Return value:**

Zero ([`PLUM_OK`][errors]) if the function succeeds, or a non-zero [error constant][errors] otherwise.

**Error values:**

The function may fail for any of the reasons specified for [`plum_validate_image`](#plum_validate_image), returning
one of the error constants listed there.

It can also return one of the following [error constants][errors]:

- `PLUM_OK` (zero): success.
  This value will be used only if the function executes without errors.
- `PLUM_ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`: there is not enough memory to complete the operation.

### `plum_pixel_buffer_size`

``` c
size_t plum_pixel_buffer_size(const struct plum_image * image);
```

**Description:**

This function calculates the size of an image's pixel buffer.
That value can be used, for example, to allocate a new pixel buffer.

For images using [indexed-color mode][indexed], this is simply the product of its dimensions (`width`, `height` and
`frames`).
For other images, it is that product times the size of each color value, as it would be calculated by
[`plum_color_buffer_size`](#plum_color_buffer_size) using the image's [color format][colors].
An image is considered to use [indexed-color mode][indexed] if its `palette` member is not a null pointer.

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image whose pixel buffer size will be calculated.

**Return value:**

If the image's dimensions are valid (as determined by [`plum_check_valid_image_size`](#plum_check_valid_image_size)),
this function returns the size of the pixel buffer.
Otherwise, or if `image` is a null pointer, this function returns 0.

### `plum_palette_buffer_size`

``` c
size_t plum_palette_buffer_size(const struct plum_image * image);
```

**Description:**

This function calculates the size of an image's palette data.
This value can be used, for example, to allocate a new palette.

The function uses the image's [color format][colors] to determine the size of each color value.
Note that this function is purely a convenience function: it is equivalent to
`plum_color_buffer_size(image -> max_palette_index + 1, image -> color_format)`.

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image whose palette buffer size will be calculated.

**Return value:**

Size of the image's palette buffer, or 0 if `image` is a null pointer.

## Memory management

These functions perform various memory management duties, allowing the user to allocate memory associated to an image
(that will be deallocated alongside the rest of the image's memory by [`plum_destroy_image`](#plum_destroy_image)).

For more information, see the [Memory management][memory] page.

### `plum_malloc`

``` c
void * plum_malloc(struct plum_image * image, size_t size);
```

**Description:**

This function allocates memory associated to an image.
(For more information, see the [Memory management][memory] page.)
As with the standard library function `malloc`, memory allocated by this function will be suitably aligned for any
built-in data type.

Memory allocated this way can be redimensioned with [`plum_realloc`](#plum_realloc), freed with
[`plum_free`](#plum_free), or deallocated automatically by [`plum_destroy_image`](#plum_destroy_image).

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image that the allocated buffer will be linked to.
  Must not be a null pointer.
- `size`: size of the allocated buffer.

**Return value:**

Pointer to the allocated buffer, or a null pointer if there isn't enough memory available (or if `image` is a null
pointer).
Note that this function will never return a null pointer on success, even if `size` is zero.

### `plum_calloc`

``` c
void * plum_calloc(struct plum_image * image, size_t size);
```

**Description:**

This function is equivalent to [`plum_malloc`](#plum_malloc), but it also zeroes out the allocated buffer, like the
standard library function `calloc` does.

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image that the allocated buffer will be linked to.
  Must not be a null pointer.
- `size`: size of the allocated buffer.

**Return value:**

Pointer to the allocated buffer, or a null pointer if there isn't enough memory available (or if `image` is a null
pointer).
Note that this function will never return a null pointer on success, even if `size` is zero.

### `plum_realloc`

``` c
void * plum_realloc(struct plum_image * image, void * buffer, size_t size);
```

**Description:**

This function resizes a buffer previously allocated by [`plum_malloc`](#plum_malloc) or [`plum_calloc`](#plum_calloc)
(possibly already redimensioned by prior calls to this function).

Similarly to the standard library function `realloc`, if reallocation succeeds, data in the buffer will be moved to
its new location.
If the buffer becomes larger, the extra space will be uninitialized; if the buffer becomes smaller, the end of the
original data will be truncated away.

As with the standard library function `realloc`, buffers reallocated by this function will be suitably aligned for any
built-in data type.

If `buffer` is a null pointer, this function behaves exactly like `plum_malloc(image, size)`.
This is consistent with what `malloc` does.

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image that the buffer is associated to; the buffer will continue to be associated to it.
  Must not be a null pointer.
- `buffer`: buffer to redimension (and possibly relocate).
  If this argument is a null pointer, a new buffer will be allocated, as if by [`plum_malloc`](#plum_malloc).
- `size`: new size for the buffer.
  Note that the buffer will **not** be freed if this argument is zero.

**Return value:**

Pointer to the redimensioned buffer (which may or may not be equal to its old address), or a null pointer if there
isn't enough memory available (or if `image` is a null pointer).
Note that this function will never return a null pointer on success, even if `size` is zero.

### `plum_allocate_metadata`

``` c
struct plum_metadata * plum_allocate_metadata(struct plum_image * image,
                                              size_t size);
```

**Description:**

This function allocates a [`struct plum_metadata`][metadata-struct] and its associated data buffer in a single
allocation, allowing the user to release them both with a single call to [`plum_free`](#plum_free).
The returned value will point to the allocated [`struct plum_metadata`][metadata-struct], and the struct's `data`
member will point to the associated data buffer; the struct's `size` member will also be initialized to the correct
value.
(The struct's remaining members will be zero-initialized.)

[Metadata nodes][metadata] allocated this way may be freed with [`plum_free`](#plum_free) or deallocated automatically
by [`plum_destroy_image`](#plum_destroy_image).
The node's associated data buffer (i.e., its `data` member) **must not** be freed, since it belongs to the same
allocation as the node itself, and therefore will be freed when the node is freed.

Since the distance between the node's address and the address of its associated data buffer is intentionally not
specified, it is not recommended to use [`plum_realloc`](#plum_realloc) to redimension a node allocated this way.
Nevertheless, the node behaves exactly like any other buffer allocated by [`plum_malloc`](#plum_malloc), and therefore
_can_ be redimensioned this way if appropriate care is taken.

The node's associated data buffer will be suitably aligned for any built-in data type, as with any other buffer
allocated by these functions.

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image that the allocated buffer will be linked to.
  Must not be a null pointer.
- `size`: size to allocate for the [metadata node][metadata]'s associated data buffer.

**Return value:**

Pointer to the allocated [`struct plum_metadata`][metadata-struct], or a null pointer if there isn't enough memory
available (or if `image` is a null pointer).
The allocated struct's `data` and `size` members will be initialized to the associated data buffer and its size.

### `plum_append_metadata`

``` c
unsigned plum_append_metadata(struct plum_image * image, int type,
                              const void * data, size_t size);
```

**Description:**

This function will allocate a new [metadata node][metadata] through the
[`plum_allocate_metadata`](#plum_allocate_metadata) function, fill it with the supplied type and data, and append it
to the image's metadata at the head of its `metadata` linked list.

This function is implemented merely as a convenience: it is equivalent to performing those steps manually.

Note: the data is copied to the new node (via `memcpy`); the new node will _not_ contain a pointer to `data`.

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image where the metadata will be appended; the allocated node will be linked to it.
- `type`: type of the metadata node; its `type` member will be set to this value.
  For positive, library-defined types, this should be one of the [metadata constants][metadata-constants].
- `data`: data that will be copied to the new [metadata node][metadata].
  Should not be a null pointer unless `size` is zero.
- `size`: size of the data that will be copied to the new [metadata node][metadata] (i.e., size of the buffer pointed
  to by `data`); this value will also be used as the new node's `size` member.

**Return value:**

If appending a new [metadata node][metadata] is successful, this function returns zero (`PLUM_OK`).
Otherwise, the function will return a non-zero [error constant][errors] indicating the reason for the failure.

**Error values:**

These are the possible error values that the function can return:

- `PLUM_OK` (zero): success.
  This value will be returned if the new node is appended to the image's metadata.
- `PLUM_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS`: `image` is a null pointer, or `data` is a null pointer while `size` is non-zero.
- `PLUM_ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`: there is not enough memory available to allocate the new metadata node.

### `plum_free`

``` c
void plum_free(struct plum_image * image, void * buffer);
```

**Description:**

This function frees a buffer previously allocated with any of the other
[memory management functions](#memory-management).
This is equivalent to the standard library function `free`: the buffer ceases to exist and its memory is returned to
the system.

If `buffer` is a null pointer, this function is a harmless no-op, just like `free`.

If `image` is a null pointer, this function is equivalent to `free(buffer)`.
(In other words, it calls the standard library function `free` directly.)
This can be used to free the memory allocated with `malloc` when [`plum_store_image`](#plum_store_image) is called
with a `size_mode` argument of [`PLUM_MODE_BUFFER`][mode-constants]; it is only intended for users that may not have
access to the C standard library, or to the exact allocator used by this library.
(For example, bindings for other languages may need to use this special mode.)

**Arguments:**

- `image`: image that the buffer is associated to.
  If this value is a null pointer, it triggers the special mode mentioned in the description.
- `buffer`: buffer to deallocate.
  If this value is a null pointer, the function does nothing.

**Return value:** none.

## Library information

These functions retrieve information from the library itself, not linked to an image.

### `plum_get_file_format_name`

``` c
const char * plum_get_file_format_name(unsigned format);
```

**Description:**

This function returns a human-readable string that describes a [file format value][types].
For example, if `format` is [`PLUM_IMAGE_BMP`][types], this function returns `"BMP"`.

The returned string is a constant and must not be modified.

**Arguments:**

- `format`: format whose name will be retrieved; it will usually be one of the [format constants][types].

**Return value:**

If `format` is a valid [format value][types], the function returns a constant string naming that format.
If `format` is [`PLUM_IMAGE_NONE`][types] or an out-of-range value, the function returns a null pointer.

### `plum_get_error_text`

``` c
const char * plum_get_error_text(unsigned error);
```

**Description:**

This function returns an error message for each [error constant][errors].

The returned string is a constant and must not be modified.

**Arguments:**

- `error`: error value for which an error message will be retrieved; it will usually be an [error constant][errors].

**Return value:**

If `error` is a valid [error constant][errors] (including [`PLUM_OK`][errors]), the function returns an error message
describing it.
If `error` is out of range, the function returns a null pointer.

### `plum_get_version_number`

``` c
uint32_t plum_get_version_number(void);
```

**Description:**

This function returns the library's version number, in the format described in the [Version constants][version]
section.

This value will be equal to [`PLUM_VERSION`][feature-macros] if the included library header has the same version
number as the compiled library source.

**Arguments:** none.

**Return value:**

Version number, as described in the [Version constants][version] section.
